\problem{5 (a)} From the text, the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are 
$$\lambda_{l,m} = 4 - 2 \big( \cos(l \pi h) + \cos(m \pi h) \big)$$
where $1 \leq l,m \leq N$ and $h = \frac{1}{N+1}$. Note that these are all positive values, and thus $A$ is not just symmetric, but SPD. Then $\norm{A}_2 = \rho(A) = \lambda_{\text{max}}$ and $\norm{A^{-1}}_2 = \rho(A^{-1}) = \lambda_{\text{min}}$. \break

Since the argument to each Cosine function in the formula above is between $0$ and $\pi$ we know that it will be increasing as each $l$ and $m$ increase. Thus the largest eigenvalue will be given by the largest values of $l$ and $m$ and the smallest eigenvalue will be given by the smallest values of $l$ and $m$. Thus 
\begin{align*}
	\lambda_\text{max} & = 4 - 2 \big( \cos(N \pi h) + \cos(N \pi h) \big) \\
	& = 4 - 4 \cos\left(\frac{N }{N+1}\pi \right) \\
	\lambda_\text{min} & = 4 - 2 \big( \cos(1 \pi h) + \cos(1 \pi h) \big) \\
	& = 4 - 4 \cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right)
\end{align*}
Due to symmetries of Cosine $\cos\left(\frac{N }{N+1}\pi \right) = -\cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right)$ and we can rewrite
$$
\lambda_\text{max} = 4 + 4 \cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right)
$$
Finally we find that the condition number of $A$ is given by
\begin{align*}
	\kappa(A) & = \left( 4 + 4 \cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right) \right) 
		\left( 4 - 4 \cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right) \right)^{-1} \\
	& = \frac{1 + \cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right)}{ 1 - \cos\left(\frac{1 }{N+1}\pi \right)}
\end{align*}
As $N$ gets large, the numerator approaches $2$ and the denominator approaches $0$, thus the condition number gets large. We can verify this by using Taylor Series approximations
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1 + \cos(x)}{ 1 - \cos(x)} & \approx \frac{1 + 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}}{1 - 1 + \frac{x^2}{2}} \\
	& = \frac{2 - \frac{x^2}{2}}{\frac{x^2}{2}} \\
	& = \frac{4}{x^2} - 1 \\
	\kappa(A) & \approx \left( \frac{2}{\frac{1}{N+1}\pi} \right)^2 \\
	& = \left( \frac{2N + 2}{\pi} \right)^2 \\
	& = \mathcal{O}(N^2) \\
	& = \mathcal{O}(n)
\end{align*}
As expected the condition number scales linearly with the discretization.
